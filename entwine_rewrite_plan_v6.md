# Entwine App Rewrite: Architectural Plan (v6 - Final)

## 1. Introduction & Goals

*   **Objective:** Rewrite the Entwine application in a new repository to achieve cleaner code, improved scalability (target ~3000 concurrent users), enhanced security, and native support for future iOS/Android mobile clients via React Native.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This document pertains to the **EntwineRewrite** project located at `C:\Users\matti\Desktop\EntwineRewrite`. This is a separate codebase from the original application (`SoulConnectionPlatform`). All development, commands, and file paths referenced herein should be relative to the `EntwineRewrite` directory unless explicitly stated otherwise.

*   **Core Concepts:** Retain the fundamental features and concepts of the original application (AI matching, communication analysis, coaching, admin console), including multi-dimensional ranking and contextual AI coaching.
*   **Asset Reuse:** Utilize existing logos, branding, and other relevant static assets from the current application.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **API-First:** Design the backend as a standalone API consumed by multiple clients (web, mobile).
*   **Statelessness:** Backend services will be stateless to facilitate scaling and simplify client interactions.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations from the outset.
*   **Scalability:** Architect components (API, database, real-time, caching) with the target user load in mind.
*   **Testability:** Structure code for effective unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
*   **Shared Code:** Maximize code sharing (types, validation, core logic) between backend and clients.
*   **Environment Parity & Isolation:** Maintain distinct environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) with isolated data stores.
*   **Contextual AI Assistance:** Leverage AI for matching and real-time guidance during user interactions.
*   **Data-Driven Insights:** Provide users with clear, multi-faceted insights into compatibility.
*   **AI Model Flexibility:** Allow administrators to configure and select specific AI models from various providers per feature.

## 6. Key Workflows & Implementation Details

### 6.1 Registration Flow Sequence

The application will guide new users through a multi-step registration process designed to gather comprehensive profile information for effective matching and coaching. The planned sequence is as follows:

1.  **Initial Signup:** User provides basic credentials (e.g., phone number, password) and potentially name/gender. An initial user record is created (`registrationStep: 0`).
2.  **Basic Profile:** User provides core profile details (e.g., birthday, location, bio, initial profile photo upload). (`registrationStep: 1`). The uploaded photo triggers AI analysis for physical attributes.
3.  **Dating Preferences:** User specifies preferences for potential matches (e.g., gender, age range, distance). (`registrationStep: 2`).
4.  **Photo Rating (Physical Preference Elicitation):** User rates a series of photos to help the AI understand their physical preferences more deeply. The number of photos shown may vary based on user settings. (`registrationStep: 3`). Results update the `physicalPreferences` data.
5.  **AI Relationship Coach Interaction:** User engages in a structured conversation with the AI coach (potentially using pre-defined questions from `coachConfig`) to elicit core values, relationship goals, and other key compatibility factors. (`registrationStep: 4`). Results populate `userValues` and potentially other profile sections. Requires `introScreens` of type `relationship_coach`.
6.  **AI Persona Chats (Communication Style & Interest Elicitation):** User chats sequentially with **exactly 6 different** AI personas matching their preferences. A minimum number of interactions (e.g., **6 messages** from the user) per persona is required to proceed. (`registrationStep: 5`).
    *   **Data Derivation:** Chat data (user messages) is sent to backend services which utilize the configured AI model (via the AI Abstraction Layer) to analyze linguistic patterns (inferring communication style metrics like directness, expressiveness) and extract keywords/topics (identifying potential user interests). These results populate the `communicationStyles` and `userInterests` data.
    *   **UI/UX:** The user interacts via a chat interface. Clear indicators will show which persona is active (e.g., "Chatting with Persona 3 of 6") and track interaction progress (e.g., "Messages sent: 4/6"). Navigation controls (e.g., "Next Persona") will be enabled only after the minimum interaction count for the current persona is met.
    *   Requires `introScreens` of type `ai_chat` to be displayed before this step begins.
7.  **Registration Complete:** Upon successful completion of all steps, the `registrationStep` is updated, and the `profileComplete` flag is set to `true`, granting access to the main application features.

*Note: The `registrationStep` field in the `users` table tracks the user's progress through this flow, allowing them to resume if they leave and come back.*

### 6.2 Key Architectural Changes & Implementation Details (Previously Section 6)

*   **Monorepo Setup:** â DONE - Structure using `apps/` and `packages/`. Configured Turborepo/pnpm. Initial packages (`api`, `web`, `mobile`, `shared`, configs) created. Dependencies installed and linked. Updated `turbo.json` build task outputs to include `dist/**` for better caching.
*   **GraphQL API:** â DONE (Basic Setup) - Schema-first design using Apollo Server. Basic schema files loaded. Placeholder resolvers implemented. Basic server running.
*   **Authentication (JWT):** â DONE (Backend Complete), â DONE (Client-Side Integration), â DONE (Login/Signup UI), â DONE (Protected Routes) - Backend: Implemented access token strategy (Passport JWT), registration/login logic (`AuthService` with bcrypt/JWT), context integration, placeholder secrets, and refresh token storage/validation using Redis (`AuthService`). Completed GraphQL integration (`refreshToken` mutation/resolver). **Client-Side (`apps/web`):** Implemented `AuthContext` using React Context and Apollo Client hooks (handles token storage, login/logout, token attachment, refresh). Integrated `ApolloProvider` and `AuthProvider` into `layout.tsx`. Created `ProtectedRoute` component (`apps/web/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) using `useAuth` hook to handle redirection based on auth state. Applied `ProtectedRoute` to main page (`apps/web/app/page.tsx`). **UI:** Set up Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `globals.css`). Installed `lucide-react`. Added Shadcn UI (`components.json`, base color: Zinc) and necessary components (`button`, `input`, `label`, `card`, `alert`). Created `LoginForm` and `SignupForm` components (`apps/web/app/auth/components/`) using Shadcn UI, context, and GraphQL mutations. Created corresponding pages (`/login`, `/signup`). Added navigation links between forms.
*   **Database & Indexing:** â DONE (Schema & Initial Migrations) - Refined Drizzle schema defined in `packages/shared`. Drizzle Kit configured. Initial migration generated and applied. DB client setup in `apps/api`. Manual migrations applied up to `0006` (interest flags). (Further indexing TBD).
*   **Real-time (Hybrid):** â DONE (Backend Complete), â DONE (Client-Side UI Refinements) - Backend: Integrated `socket.io` with HTTP server (`apps/api/src/index.ts`), including JWT auth, basic chat persistence, push notifications via `PushService`, and event handlers for typing indicators/read receipts (with DB updates). **Client-Side Setup:** Installed `socket.io-client`, created `SocketContext` (`apps/web/context/SocketContext.tsx`), integrated `SocketProvider` (`apps/web/app/layout.tsx`). **Created basic chat UI components:** `ChatWindow.tsx`, `MessageList.tsx`, `MessageInput.tsx`, `TypingIndicator.tsx` in `apps/web/app/components/`. Integrated `ChatWindow` into `apps/web/app/page.tsx`. **Enhancements:** Replaced placeholder user ID in `page.tsx` with actual ID from `AuthContext`. Implemented fetching initial chat messages in `ChatWindow.tsx` using Apollo `useQuery` and `GET_MESSAGES_QUERY` (defined in `apps/web/graphql/queries.ts`). Updated `MessageList.tsx` to use `createdAt` field. Added basic loading/error states for message fetching. **UI Refinements:** Implemented scroll-to-bottom in `MessageList.tsx`. Added improved error handling (connection status, message send failures) in `ChatWindow.tsx`. (Next: Further UI/UX improvements as needed).
*   **Caching Strategy (Redis):** â DONE (Verified) - Installed `ioredis`. Created Redis client configuration (`apps/api/src/config/redis.ts`). Integrated Redis for refresh token management (`AuthService`), user profile caching (`MatchingService`), etc. **Update:** Verified `REDIS_URL` is correctly set in `.env`. Confirmed `AuthService` calls in `index.ts` are active. Restarted API server (`pnpm run dev`) and observed successful Redis client initialization logs ("AuthService initialized...", "Matching Service initialized..."). (Next: Manually test auth mutations and caching features for full verification. Further optimization/invalidation strategies TBD).
*   **Environments & Testing Strategy:** â DONE (DB Isolation) - Defined Dev, Staging, Prod environments. Using isolated database for Dev. (Mock data script is PENDING).
    *   **IMPORTANT NOTE:** This rewrite project uses its own `.env` file located in the project root (`C:/Users/matti/Desktop/EntwineRewrite/.env`). Configuration values (Database URLs, API Keys, JWT Secrets) in this file pertain **only** to the rewrite project and its dedicated services (like the new development database). Do **not** confuse this with the `.env` file or services used by the original application located elsewhere. Ensure all credentials used here are intended for this separate rewrite environment.
*   **Matching & Ranking Service:** â DONE (Implementation Complete), â DONE (Expanded Test Coverage) - Implemented core service logic in `apps/api/src/modules/matching/matching.service.ts`, including fetching users, preference filtering, dealbreaker checks, location/distance filtering (Haversine), multi-dimensional scoring, and AI integration (via `AIService`) for communication style and physical preference alignment. Updated GraphQL resolver (`matching.resolver.ts`). Created initial test suite (`matching.service.test.ts`) and significantly expanded coverage, including tests for filtering, sorting, limits, reciprocity, Jaccard calculations, AI errors, missing data, score clamping, and weight normalization. (Next: Monitor performance, add integration tests if needed).
*   **AI Coaching Service:** â DONE (Core Logic + Interactive Feedback + Resolver History Fetching) - Implemented core service logic in `apps/api/src/modules/coaching/coaching.service.ts`, including dynamic config loading, registration Q&A flow (`handleRegistrationTurn`), and post-session analysis (`analyzeRegistrationConversation` with DB updates for `userValues` and `communicationStyles`). Replaced placeholder `getInChatSuggestions` with `getFeedbackForChat` supporting interactive feedback requests ('RECENT', 'FULL', 'DRAFT'). Updated GraphQL schema (`requestChatFeedback` mutation) and resolver (`coaching.resolver.ts`), replacing placeholder chat history fetching with actual Drizzle DB queries. Added comprehensive unit tests (`coaching.service.test.ts`).
*   **AI Abstraction Layer & Model Selection:** â DONE (Google Provider + Dynamic Selection)
    *   â Defined **Simplified Interface** (`apps/api/src/ai/ai-interface.ts`) with `generateChatCompletion`, `analyzeImage`, `countTokens`.
    *   â Implemented **Provider Pattern** for Google Gemini (`apps/api/src/ai/google.provider.ts`), adhering to the interface. Includes basic error handling and token counting fallback logic.
    *   â Store **per-feature AI configuration** (provider, model name) in the database. (Schema `ai_feature_configs` created, migration `0001` applied).
    *   â Implemented **dynamic provider selection** in `AIService` (`apps/api/src/ai/ai.service.ts`). Fetches config, instantiates/caches providers based on `providerName`. Verified with unit tests (`ai.service.test.ts`).
    *   â Manage **API keys** securely (reads from `process.env`).
*   **Admin Console:** â IN PROGRESS (AI Config UI Complete, User Management - List View with Pagination Complete)
    *   **AI Config:** Implemented the UI for selecting AI provider/model per feature (`apps/web/app/admin/ai-config/page.tsx`). Backend includes GraphQL schema (`admin.graphql`), resolvers (`admin.resolver.ts`), and server integration for `getAiFeatureConfigs`, `updateAiFeatureConfig`, and `getAvailableAiProviders`. Frontend setup included codegen, query/mutation documents (`admin.gql`), and UI using Shadcn components. Auth handled via `AdminRouteGuard`.
    *   **User Management (List View):**
        *   **Backend (`apps/api`):**
            *   Added `role` column to `users` table (`packages/shared/src/schema.ts`) with `userRoleEnum` ('USER', 'ADMIN') and generated/applied migration (`0004_faulty_sunfire.sql`).
            *   Added `email`, `role`, `registrationStep` fields to `User` type (`graphql/schemas/user.graphql`).
            *   Added `AdminUser` and `AdminUserList` types to `graphql/schemas/admin.graphql`.
            *   Added `getAdminUsers` and `getAdminUser` queries to `graphql/schemas/admin.graphql`.
            *   Implemented resolvers for these queries in `graphql/resolvers/admin.resolver.ts` (including DB fetch, pagination args, ID type conversion).
            *   Added `chat.graphql` schema (defining `Message` type and `getMessagesForMatch` query) and `chat.resolver.ts` to fix a codegen validation error related to an incorrect frontend query (`GET_MESSAGES_QUERY`). Updated `index.ts` to load the chat schema/resolver.
        *   **Frontend (`apps/web`):**
            *   Created user management page component (`app/admin/users/page.tsx`).
            *   Added `GET_ADMIN_USERS` query to `graphql/queries.ts`.
            *   Added `Badge` component via Shadcn CLI (`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add badge`).
            *   Updated `codegen.ts` to load schema from backend files (instead of introspection endpoint) and to scan `.ts`/`.tsx` files for GraphQL operations.
            *   Fixed validation errors during codegen by:
                *   Removing duplicate `Login` mutation definition.
                *   Correcting `refreshToken` mutation argument name.
                *   Updating `ME_QUERY` to use `firstName`/`lastName` instead of `name`.
                *   Updating `User` interface in `AuthContext.tsx`.
                *   Correcting `GET_MESSAGES_QUERY` to use `getMessagesForMatch`.
            *   Successfully ran codegen (`pnpm --filter web run codegen`).
            *   Updated `app/admin/users/page.tsx` to use `useGetAdminUsersQuery` hook and display user list (ID, Name, Role, Profile Status, Created At) in a Shadcn UI `Table`.
            *   Implemented pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons, page info) in `app/admin/users/page.tsx` using `useState` and updating `useGetAdminUsersQuery` variables (`offset`, `limit`). Backend resolver already supported pagination arguments.
    *   **Login Troubleshooting:** Addressed several build errors related to Tailwind CSS config (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) and Next.js Client/Server component boundaries (`'use client'` directive, provider pattern). Updated backend `AuthService` and GraphQL schema/mutations to ensure the `user` object is returned upon successful login. Added a dedicated admin user to the seed script (`apps/api/src/scripts/seed.ts`). (Login issue still persists, requires further investigation).
    *   **(Next:** Debug remaining login issue. Implement user detail view, edit/disable actions, Content Moderation, Analytics Views, etc.).
    *   **(Next:** Implement pagination controls for user list, user detail view, edit/disable actions, Content Moderation, Analytics Views, etc.).
*   **Security:** â DONE (Codegen Fixed, Zod Validation Added, Basic Auth Directive Implemented) - Integrated input validation using Zod for `sendRegistrationCoachMessage`, `requestChatFeedback`, and `getPotentialMatches` GraphQL operations. Zod schemas defined in `@entwine-rewrite/shared`. Implemented a basic `@auth` directive (`apps/api/src/graphql/directives/auth.directive.ts`) to protect GraphQL fields/queries based on JWT authentication context (`context.user`). Applied directive transformer in `index.ts` and added `@auth` to the `me` query (`user.graphql`). Created placeholder `me` resolver (`user.resolver.ts`). **Note on `graphql-codegen`:** Resolved persistent errors preventing type generation. The root cause involved the codegen tool requiring the base `Mutation` type in `schema.graphql` to have at least one field defined for successful merging with `extend type Mutation` blocks. Added a dummy `_empty: Boolean` field to `schema.graphql` to fix this. Codegen now runs successfully, generating types in `apps/api/src/graphql/generated/graphql.ts`. (Next: Implement more granular authorization (roles/permissions), rate limiting, etc.). (Basic JWT structure is in place).

## 7. Development Process & Tooling

*   **Testing:** â DONE (Coaching & Matching Service Tests Expanded) - Installed Jest, `@types/jest`, `@jest/globals`, `ts-jest`, `cross-env`, `dedent`. Configured Jest for ESM/NodeNext (`apps/api/jest.config.js`, `apps/api/package.json` test script). Created unit tests for `GoogleProvider` (`google.provider.test.ts`) and `AIService` (`ai.service.test.ts`). Created comprehensive unit tests for `CoachingService` (`coaching.service.test.ts`), covering all methods including the new `getFeedbackForChat`. Fixed pre-existing failures and significantly expanded test coverage for `MatchingService` (`matching.service.test.ts`).
    *   **Note on Jest/ESM Configuration:** Setting up Jest with `ts-jest` for a `NodeNext` (ESM) project required specific configuration and troubleshooting:
        *   Using `cross-env` to set `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules` in the test script is crucial.
        *   The standard `'ts-jest'` preset was ultimately used.
        *   Explicit imports from `@jest/globals` (e.g., `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `jest`) were necessary.
        *   Mocking local modules (`jest.mock('./module')`) required careful handling, especially with module-level caches. Exporting the cache (`providerCache` from `ai.service.ts`) and clearing it in `beforeEach` proved effective for testing caching logic reliably across test runs.
        *   Editor (VS Code) TypeScript analysis might still show spurious errors related to Jest globals or relative paths even when tests pass; restarting the TS server or ignoring these specific editor errors might be needed.
    *   (Next: Write more unit/integration tests for other services, AI providers, resolvers. Set up E2E framework).
*   **Mock Data Seeding:** â DONE (Script Expanded & Executed for Dev) - Added `@faker-js/faker` dev dependency to `apps/api`. Created initial seed script `apps/api/src/scripts/seed.ts` with basic user seeding logic. Added `DATABASE_URL_DEV` to `.env`. Expanded script to seed `datingPreferences`, `userPhotos`, `userInterests`, and `userValues`. Added `db:seed` script to `apps/api/package.json`. Successfully ran migrations and seed script against the development database (`DATABASE_URL_DEV`). (Next: Integrate into Dev/Staging setup if needed).
*   **CI/CD:** â³ PENDING - Set up pipelines for linting, testing, builds, and deployments per environment.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** â DONE (Basic Setup) - ESLint/Prettier configured via Turborepo starter. (`lint` script exists).
